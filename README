SonicCPP is a reasonant sythesis engine
=======================================

Resonant sythesis is the creation of sounds by using resonant filtering.
SonicCPP offers a framework for doing this.
It has a pool based memory system which passes blocks of 1ms of samples between
processors.
Processors are stateful so they can act as filters.
There are also processors for things like tape effects and reverb.

SonicCPP does not have an interpreted DSL or any such thing.
To use it a music C++ file needs to be created.

Currently I am working on the midi parser.
When that is done I might then work on a DSL to mapping midi to processors;
but then maybe not.

It is built from the included Makefile. I am not very good at make file programming
so whilst it works on C++17/g++ on the Mac it does not currently dependency track
between headers and .cpp files. Again - one day maybe...
